# **Synchronous Reference Frame - Phase Locked Loop**


Developed a single-phase Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Locked Loop (SRF PLL) using Python procedural algorithm implementation

Created phase-continuous test signals with frequency step changes (50Hz to 100Hz) to validate PLL tracking performance

Implemented Park transformation and orthogonal signal generation using the numerical differentiation technique 

Implemented numerical integration algorithms (PI controller) using the Euler method for real-time phase error accumulation and frequency estimation
