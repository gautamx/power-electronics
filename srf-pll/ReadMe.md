Synchronous Reference Frame - Phase Locked Loop

Developed a single-phase Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Locked Loop (SRF PLL) using Python procedural algorithm implementation
Created phase-continuous test signals with frequency step changes (50Hz to 100Hz) to validate PLL tracking performance
Implemented Park transformation and orthogonal signal generation using the numerical differentiation technique 
Implemented numerical integration algorithms (PI controller) using the Euler method for real-time phase error accumulation and frequency estimation
