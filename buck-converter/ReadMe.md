# **Digital PI Controller Implementation in a Closed-loop Buck Converter Using Explicit Mathematical Modelling in Python**

•	Designed and implemented a closed-loop PI controller for a buck converter operating at 50-200 kHz switching frequency, achieving stable voltage regulation with ~5% output ripple
•	Developed a comprehensive simulation model in Python, integrating power stage dynamics, feedback control, and switching behavior with microsecond-level time resolution
•	Implemented multiple numerical integration methods, including Forward Euler, Trapezoidal Rule, and 4th-order Runge-Kutta, to optimize simulation accuracy and computational efficiency
•	Optimized controller parameters (Kp, Ki gains) and switching frequency to eliminate output voltage oscillations and improve transient response characteristics
•	Applied advanced control techniques including feedforward compensation, anti-windup protection, and duty cycle limiting,g to enhance system stability and performance
•	Developed real-time simulation framework with data logging and visualization capabilities for analyzing inductor current, output voltage, switching states, and control signals
